                Jonathan Jones, the founder of JonesCo Gutters, isn&apos;t your typical businessman. Born and raised in the heart of Kentucky, Jonathan started his career as a mechanic, honing his skills in problem-solving and meticulous craftsmanship.

              <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-200">
                Driven by a desire to help others, he later transitioned to nursing, where he learned the importance of compassion, empathy, and putting people&apos;s needs first.

              <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-200">
                These values are at the core of JonesCo Gutters. Jonathan&apos;s journey taught him that every job, no matter how big or small, deserves the utmost care and attention to detail. He brings the same passion and dedication he had as a mechanic and nurse to every gutter installation and repair.
